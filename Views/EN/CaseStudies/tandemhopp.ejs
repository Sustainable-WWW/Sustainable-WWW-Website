                        <h2 class="SWWW_H2 SWWW_MaxWidth1200">Project Challenges</h2>
                        <p class="SWWW_P P--MaxWidth900">The client faced several operational inefficiencies and user experience issues:</p>
                        <ol class="SWWW_InfoList">
                            <li>
                                <p class="SWWW_P P--MaxWidth900"><strong>Outdated Website:</strong> The previous website was visually outdated and lacked modern functionality.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="SWWW_P P--MaxWidth900"><strong>Manual Gift Card Processing:</strong> Customers had to email the company and make manual bank transfers or Swish payments, requiring staff to manually verify and process each transaction.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="SWWW_P P--MaxWidth900"><strong>Disjointed Booking Experience:</strong> Tandem jump bookings redirected users to BurbleSoft, a separate platform with a completely different visual design, creating a fragmented experience.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="SWWW_P P--MaxWidth900"><strong>Paper Waiver System:</strong> Customers signed waivers on paper upon arrival, which were manually stored, adding administrative overhead.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="SWWW_P P--MaxWidth900"><strong>Customer Journey Friction:</strong> The overall booking and preparation process was cumbersome, leading to potential customer dissatisfaction.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h2 class="SWWW_H2">Solution Implementation</h2>
                        <p class="SWWW_P P--MaxWidth900">To address these challenges, we designed and developed a fresh, modern website with several key improvements:</p>
                        <h3 class="SWWW_H3">1. Unified Design</h3>
                        <ul class="SWWW_CheckList">

                                <p class="SWWW_P P--MaxWidth900">We created a visually appealing website that aligns with the Tandemhopp.se brand identity.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="SWWW_P P--MaxWidth900">Redesigned the booking calendar and forms to match the website’s aesthetics, ensuring a seamless transition when users are redirected to BurbleSoft for tandem jump bookings.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="SWWW_H3">2. Integrated Gift Card System</h3>

                            <li>
                                <p class="SWWW_P P--MaxWidth900">Waivers are automatically linked to the booking system for easy access by staff, eliminating paper storage.</p>
                            </li>
