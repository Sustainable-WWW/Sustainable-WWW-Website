                        <p class="SWWW_P P--MaxWidth900">Mayari Animal Rescue is a small but passionate organization in Cebu City, Philippines, doing incredibly important work. They help stray dogs and cats off the streets and give them medical care, shelter, food, and a second chance at life. Their team puts their hearts into this work every single day, and we were genuinely inspired by what they do.</p>
                        <p class="SWWW_P P--MaxWidth900">We had been in touch with Dan Vetter at Mayari for a while, and the idea of designing a new website came up. The goal was to make it easier for people to donate—especially from outside the Philippines—and in that way help Mayari receive more long-term support.</p>
                        <p class="SWWW_P P--MaxWidth900">The design you see here is what came out of our collaboration. It’s lightweight, easy to navigate, and puts focus on making the donation process smooth and secure. Instead of just showing local bank details or transfer apps, which can be confusing or feel unsafe for international donors, we created clear donation paths with trusted payment options. This way, people from anywhere in the world could easily help out—without second-guessing if their money would reach the animals.</p>
                        <p class="SWWW_P P--MaxWidth900">We also designed a special “Virtual Adoption” feature. Visitors could choose a specific animal to sponsor and receive regular updates on their recovery, health, and wellbeing. The idea was to build a stronger emotional connection between supporters and the animals—and to offer another way to contribute beyond one-time donations.</p>
                        <p class="SWWW_P P--MaxWidth900">Unfortunately, Mayari had to put the website project on hold. Like many small organizations, they have to prioritize carefully, and for now, their focus has to be elsewhere. We fully understand and respect that.</p>
                        <p class="SWWW_P P--MaxWidth900">But we still wanted to share the work we did together, because we’re proud of it—and because the cause behind it is worth every bit of attention.</p>
