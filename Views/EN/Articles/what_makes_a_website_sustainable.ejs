                                <p class="SWWW_P SWWW_Ingress">Did you know that the internet emits twice as much CO2 as the entire aviation industry? Websites play a significant role in this – but it can be changed.</p>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">For the last 40 years, we have followed Moore's Law, formulated by Gordon Moore. It predicts that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every two years, which has led to exponential growth in computing power. This has created a huge market for new computers, smartphones, televisions, and other electronic devices.</p>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">As devices become faster and more powerful, the software industry often takes advantage of this extra capacity. Unfortunately, this often leads to software that is less optimized, as developers prioritize quick launches and more features over efficiency. The result is heavier programs and websites that require more energy and hardware power to function.</p>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">Moore's Law has long supported this approach, but its effect is now diminishing. We are close to the limits of what can be achieved technologically with current microchip technology. At the same time, concerns about global warming have risen, creating a global movement toward sustainable technology – and that includes sustainable web design.</p>
                                <h2 class="SWWW_H2">What Does It Mean for a Website to Be Sustainable?</h2>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">A website is essentially a piece of software that a developer has created. Depending on how this software is developed, it can either use a lot of CPU power, RAM, and storage – or very little.</p>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">A sustainable website is designed and developed to minimize resource consumption. This means that the developers behind it have followed specific techniques, principles, and processes to create a solution that is as lightweight, fast, and optimized as possible. The goal is to reduce environmental impact without compromising functionality or user experience.</p>

                                <h2 class="SWWW_H2">Why Does Your Website Emit CO2 – And What Can You Do About It?</h2>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">The internet is one of the world’s biggest CO2 offenders, but there is a lot we can do to change that. Did you know that the entire global aviation sector accounts for 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions – while the internet contributes 4%? And this number is increasing, especially with the rise of AI technologies.</p>
                                <h3 class="SWWW_H3">Why Does the Internet Emit CO2?</h3>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">The internet requires enormous resources to function:</p>
                                <ul class="SWWW_InfoList">
                                    <li>
                                        <p class="SWWW_P"><strong>Power Consumption:</strong> Servers, data centers, network equipment, and your devices all use power – often generated from fossil fuels.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p class="SWWW_P"><strong>Raw Materials:</strong> The production of computers, smartphones, and other electronics requires the extraction of rare metals and other resources that burden the environment.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p class="SWWW_P"><strong>Water Consumption:</strong> Data centers around the world use enormous amounts of fresh water for cooling. In fact, only 2-3% of the world’s water is freshwater, and a significant portion is used to keep servers running – often in areas that are already suffering from drought.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3 class="SWWW_H3">A Future with Sustainable Internet</h3>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">If we want to reduce the CO2 footprint of the internet and ensure a more sustainable technological future, we need to change the way we create and use websites. Websites play a central role in this transition, and your business can be part of the solution.</p>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">When developing a new website – or updating your existing one – you face an important choice. By selecting a developer focused on sustainability, you can significantly reduce your website's environmental impact.</p>
                                <h3 class="SWWW_H3">How You Can Make a Difference</h3>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">Sustainable websites are not just about technology – they are about choices:</p>
                                <ul class="SWWW_InfoList">
                                    <li>
                                        <p class="SWWW_P">Use greener hosting solutions.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p class="SWWW_P">Optimize your website to use fewer resources.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p class="SWWW_P">Remove outdated or redundant content that unnecessarily burdens the servers.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p class="SWWW_P">Create a light and fast user experience that also saves energy.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">Every single decision counts. By choosing to build a sustainable website, you are not only helping the environment – you are also sending a strong message to your customers and partners that you take responsibility.</p>
                                <h2 class="SWWW_H2">How Does a Website Emit Greenhouse Gases?</h2>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">A website is hosted on a server, which is either located in a data center or at your premises. These servers are typically on 24/7 and require large amounts of power – often generated from fossil fuels like coal power.</p>
                                <p class="SWWW_P"><strong>But it’s not just the server’s power consumption that emits CO2. Every time someone visits your website, an energy-intensive process is triggered:</strong></p>
                                <ul class="SWWW_InfoList">
                                    <li>
                                        <p class="SWWW_P">A request is sent from the user's device to the router, through the ISP, through several stations, and finally to the data center where your website is hosted.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p class="SWWW_P">The server processes the request, retrieves the data, and sends it back through the same process.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">The longer the distance and the larger the data volume, the more energy is consumed – both by the server, the data center, the network equipment, and the user’s device.</p>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">Everything stored in the “cloud” physically exists in data centers somewhere in the world, requiring massive resources. This applies to websites, YouTube videos, emails, streaming services, and video calls. The internet is a large consumer of energy and therefore a significant source of CO2 emissions.</p>
                                <h2 class="SWWW_H2">7 Reasons to Choose a Sustainable Website</h2>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">A sustainable website benefits not only your business, but also your customers and the environment. Here are some of the advantages:</p>
