                                <p class="SWWW_P">The internet is one of the world’s largest energy consumers, and every website contributes to the global CO₂ footprint. But what if your website could not only create results for your business but also make a positive difference for the environment?</p>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">Sustainable websites are not just the solution of the future – they are a necessity for businesses that want to remain relevant and responsible. In this article, we show why sustainable websites are the future and how they can save you money, strengthen your visibility, and improve your brand.</p>
                                <h2 class="SWWW_H2">What is a Sustainable Website?</h2>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">A sustainable website is one that is developed with a focus on efficiency, accessibility, and the environment. It uses fewer resources, making it faster, more user-friendly, and less burdensome for the planet.</p>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">Traditional websites often become heavy and inefficient because features are added without focus on optimization. The result? Websites that are slow, expensive to host, and unnecessarily taxing on the environment.</p>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">With sustainable principles, we can minimize resource consumption and reduce hosting costs – while creating better user experiences. It is not just an investment in the planet but also in your company’s future.</p>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">You can read more about what makes a website sustainable in this article: “<a href="/articles/what-makes-a-website-sustainable">What Makes a Website Sustainable?</a>”</p>
                                <h2 class="SWWW_H2">Why Does the Internet Harm the Environment?</h2>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">The internet plays a surprisingly large role in the climate crisis. Every search, stream, or website visit requires energy, often from fossil fuels. Data centers that power the internet account for around 4-5% of the world’s total CO₂ emissions, whereas the entire aviation sector accounts for only 2%. In addition to electricity use, recent research has also found that a large amount of the earth’s freshwater/drinking water is used for cooling the world’s data centers (often in areas already suffering from drought), and that the internet requires a significant amount of rare minerals to produce equipment to keep the internet running as well as products to interact with the internet.</p>
                                <p class="SWWW_P">Fortunately, we can do something about it. Sustainable websites reduce environmental impact by optimizing code, compressing files, and choosing green hosting. This means less energy consumption and a lower climate burden.</p>
                                <h2 class="SWWW_H2">The Benefits of Sustainable Websites</h2>
